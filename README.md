This repo is not finished and might never be.
There are accuracy issues and i believe its caused by the binaryCrossEntropy cost function. Should replace it with a CategoricalCrossEntropy function possibly.
It's not because of the function specifically but more because my dataset is incredibly small and im expecting 2 output neurons to fit the labels, using categorical should adjust for that in some scenarios.

Or i should man up and draw more circles, we'll see. If i get some extra time I'll do so.
